    * removed sub-package `util` as it only contained one class
    * Wrapped example and test matrix into JUnit test case
    * Corrected some of the Javadoc entries according to Javadoc error/warnings
    * created open module `net.raumzeitfalle.jama`

2012-11-09 Bruce Miller
	* Version 1.0.3 Released.
	* Patched hqr2 method in net.raumzeitfalle.jama.EigenvalueDecomposition
	to avoid infinite loop;
	Thanks Frederic Devernay <frederic.devernay@m4x.org>
	* Updated unchecked type coding in Matrix read.
	* Added serialization ID to net.raumzeitfalle.jama.Matrix and Decomposition classes.
	* Cleaned up javadoc documentation to net.raumzeitfalle.jama.Matrix and Decomposition classes.

	* Version 1.0.2 Released.

	* Although SVD sometimes fails on cases m < n,
	the test code, apparently successfully, invokes
	SVD to compute rank on an m<n matrix. Deferring
	proposal to signal error on m < n, for now.
	Possible fix to generalize SVD to come later.

2005-03-04 Roldan Pozo
	* Updated CholeskyDecomposition to fix problem with scaling by
	diagonals; modified TestMatrix to better test this case.

2003-07-28 Cleve Moler
	* Updated SingularValueDecomposition to repair lack of convergience
	on rank deficient matrices.
	* Note that SVD still doesn't handle m < n
	Apparently this case can be handled by a pre-transposition,
	or more directly by a modification to the source, but this
	modified version isn't available yet.

2000-09-11 Bruce Miller <bruce.miller@nist.gov>
	* Version 1.0.1 Released.

2000-09-11 Bruce Miller <bruce.miller@nist.gov>
	* net.raumzeitfalle.jama.Matrix print methods which create a NumberFormat, now set its
	Locale to US so that the reader will recognize them even when the
	default locale is not US.  Similar change to net.raumzeitfalle.jama.TestMatrix.
	(Thanks Ulrich Eberhardinger <u.eberhardinger@ipc.uni-stuttgart.de>)

1998-08-05 The Jama Team
	* Initial Version released (1.0.0)
