# Image Placement

## Goals

* Learn how to implement a construction kit for various transforms used in photomask image placement 
  using Javas functional elements
* Experimenting to find suitable data types and data flows for easy use and extendability
* Try to make model parameter names and class names to speak for them selves, ideally 
  end up with a fluent API which uses builder pattern for setup
* The library should behave as lazy as possible 
* It should be numerically and technically correct 
* Try more advanced transforms beyond rigid (alignment) and affine (6-parameter first 
  order). Technically n-parameters higher order should work.
* Decouple matrix computation (equation solving) from high level transform code so 
  that matrix libraries can be exchanged (e.g. using La4J instead of Jama)
* Make all core elements immutable, improve design step by step to achieve concurrency 
  for large data sets (improve speed by using fork-join, try to use async using CompletableFutures) 
* Consider use of Units-of-Measurement API (JSR385)
* Learn how project Valhalla works in Java 14

## Todos
* Handle 1D cases (handling of individual missing points already works)
* Define high level API (ideally fluent or builder based) to compose evaluations.
* Fluent-API for selecting specific displacements for alignment, positional calculation, 
  first order calculation

* Implement higher order polynomial model with configurable coefficients (polynomial 
  model should work up to 9th order, coefficients to be used shall be configurable independently for x and y)
* Sum up learnings and reshape structure of alignment/correction classes, possibly add 
  higher level functions to do the all-in-one-job as its done in the demos.   

* Move to Java 14 and play with project Valhalla (Value Types/Value Objects, JEP169)

## Example Code

```java
    
    /* STEP 1, load displacements from file (or any other source)
     *
     * The CSV file may look like:
     * "refx","refy","posx","posy","diffx","diffy","type"
     * 10980.0,9012.5,10980.014331404400,9012.481628831100,0.014331404400,-0.018371168900,"ALIGN"
     * 10980.0,73512.5,10980.009388937700,73512.484174799200,0.009388937700,-0.015825200800,"REG_MARK"
     * 10980.0,143387.5,10980.004598393400,143387.490394277000,0.004598393400,-0.009605722700,"ALIGN"
     * ....
     * 146975.0,14925.0,146975.030283248000,NaN,0.030283248900,NaN,"INFO_ONLY"
     * 
     * All values are stored with the same unit, in this example all columns consist
     * of values in microns. The values in columns (diffx,diffy) are not used.
     * In case of one-dimensionality or missing values, NaN can be used.
     * 
     */

    List<Displacement> displacements = new FileLoader().load(Paths.get("Demo-4Point.csv"));
        
    /*
     * 
     * Each Displacement consists of a design location (x,y) and the actual displaced
     * location (xd,yd). By default, each Displacement is of type REG, but depending
     * on declaration in CSV file, a different DisplacementClass can be assigned.
     * The DisplacementClass allows to create simple predicates to select Displacmemt  
     * instances for different operations.
     *
     */
    

    // STEP 2, perform site selection
    Predicate<Displacement> allSites = d->true;
     
    SiteSelection selection = SiteSelection
                        .forAlignment(d -> d.isOfType(DisplacementClass.ALIGN))
                        .forCalculation(allSites)
                        .build()
                        .remove(d->d.isOfType(DisplacementClass.INFO_ONLY));
    
    // STEP 3, parametrize evaluation model 
    FirstOrderSetup setup = FirstOrderSetup
                        .usingAlignment(Alignments.SELECTED)
                        .withCompensations(Compensations.SCALE, Compensations.ORTHO)
                        .withSiteSelection(selection);

    // STEP 4, perform correction and calculate results
    FirstOrderResult result = FirstOrderCorrection.using(displacements, setup);
    Collection<Displacement> results = result.getDisplacements();

    /* 
     *  Alternatively:
     *
     *  FirstOrderCorrection correction = new FirstOrderCorrection();
     *  results = correction.apply(displacements, setup).getDisplacements();
     * 
     *  As FirstOrderCorrection is a function, .andThen(...) and .compose(...) 
     *  can be used as well. 
     *
     */  
    
    // STEP 5, print results
        
    // Now print results before correction
    DisplacementSummary uncorrectedSummary = Displacement.summarize(displacements, selection.getCalculation());
    System.out.println(uncorrectedSummary);
        
    // after correction
    DisplacementSummary correctedSummary = Displacement.summarize(results, selection.getCalculation());
    System.out.println(correctedSummary);
        
    // now also print residual first order and alignment
    RigidTransform correctedAlignment = result.getAlignment();
    System.out.println(correctedAlignment);
        
    AffineTransform correctedFirstOrder = result.getFirstOrder();
    System.out.println(correctedFirstOrder);
